# monochrome-push-menu
A responsive, sleek off-canvas push menu for navigation, made with CSS and jQuery.

Originally designed and built for my personal site but was discarded due to a redesign.

To use, download the HTML, CSS, and script files, along with the asset images in the 'images' file. Images are in SVG format.
